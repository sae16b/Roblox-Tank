# Roblox-Tank
Given a velocity and a position to shoot at, a projectile is fired at a calculated angle to hit its target

There will actually be two angles calculated, one directly aimed at the target, and the other causing a steeper parabolic motion. The angle is chosen based on whether or not there is an object in between the tank and the target. If there is, the steeper angle is chosen, as this will help avoiding the obstacle, and consequently hit the target.
